LibAREA is a library that allows for creating toolpaths for pocketing

This version is tweaked in (at least) the following ways:

-Fixed CMakeLists.txt from https://github.com/aewallin/libarea
-Modified CDxfRead::DoRead to
	-properly read units from DXF files
	-correct some dubious braces in if/else statements, which were causing issues with reading DXF files (eg, complaining about missing layer names)
-Added Python binding for CCurve::GetBox
